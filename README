Xamarin Web and Http Tests
==========================

* NetworkTools: iOS 'netstat' library and sample app which creates many concurrent
  http requests to test connection reuse under heavy load.

* Xamarin.WebTests: NUnitLite unit test project for the web/http stack.

* Xamarin.WebTests.iOS: same for iOS.

* Xamarin.WebTests.Android: same for Android.

The tests require the NUnitLite NuGet package, before running them the first time, you
need to open the solution in Xamarin Studio, right-click "References" and select
"Restore NuGet Packages".
